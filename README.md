# Orgo-Games
A series of mini-games to help students of organic chemistry prepare for test. 
The games can also be useful as drills for those not in a course.

Built on top of Sinatra, but the functionality of the games is entirely JavaScript. 

For the Newman Projection game, an external library - Propeller.js was used to rotate the back carbon. 
  This library was beneficial because it makes it easy to get the angle rotated. The angle was then compared with an expected   value, unique for each molecule.
  
The chair flip game was developed using HTML 5 Canvas and JS. Nodes were drawn in the canvas on top of a PNG of two cyclohexanes in flipped chair conformtaions. I was inspired by a mobile app called chairs@ http://ochemprep.com/games  .
